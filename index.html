                    <h2>Living In San Diego</h2>
                    <p>I lived in San Diego from the fall of 2012 until December, 2018. I decided to move back to the Saint Louis area 
                        so that I could start a better career and be closer to family. I decided to make my move home a road trip. I traveled
                        by myself to a few different places.
                        <br>
                        This is a picture of me with some friends in San Diego.

                    <p>I lived in San Diego from 2012 through 2018. I traveled to Zion National Park twice. Once in July with my friend Eddie. I went
                        again by myself in December, 2018, on my trip home.</p>
